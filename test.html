    <h1>My Favorite Movie: <cite>Inception</cite></h1>
    <p>
        The movie <strong>Inception</strong> is one of the most <em>mind-bending</em> 
        films I have ever watched.  
        Directed by <cite>Christopher Nolan</cite>, this film explores the concept of 
        <dfn>shared dreaming</dfn> â€” a world where people can enter and manipulate dreams.  
        The plot revolves around a skilled thief named Dom Cobb, who is an expert in 
        <abbr title="Extracting Information from Subconscious">EIS</abbr>.  
        One of my favorite scenes is marked by the famous line: 
        <mark>"You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling."</mark>
        Even though the story is complex, the ideas about reality and dreams are 
        presented in a way that makes the audience think <small>(sometimes too hard!)</small>
